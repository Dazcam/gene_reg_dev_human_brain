snATACseq analysis with ArchR - batch correction.

*** 

### Results {.tabset}

#### Batch Effects

This is correcting for per-sample batch effects. More covariates can be added.

```{R, clusters_harmony, echo=FALSE}
ggAlignPlots(clusters_UMAP_har, clusters_UMAP_BySample_har, type = "h")
```

***

**Batch corrected cell counts per cluster**

```{R, Cluster_cnts_harmony, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(clusters_cnts_harmony)
```

***

**Confusion Matrix**

Showing cell counts per donor in each cluster. The threshold for cluster inclusion at this stage is clusters must have at least 10 cells from 2 out of 3 donors to be included in downstream analyses. All clusters pass this threshold for GE.


```{R, Cluster_CM_harmony, echo=FALSE}
clust_CM_harmony
```

***

**Plots to compare LSI based and batch corrected based clusters**

**Confusion matrix**

```{R, Cluster_CM_harmony_compare, echo=FALSE}
clust_CM_harmony_compare
```

***

**Clustree**

```{R, clusttree_harmony_compare, echo=FALSE}
clustTree_harmony_plot
```
